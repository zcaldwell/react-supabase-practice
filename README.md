# Supabase Practice

1. Create a new Supabase project
1. Copy the keys into `.env.development.local`
1. Seed your database using `seeds.sql` by copy / pasting the SQl commands into the SQL Editor on Supabase
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm test` -- you should have 8 failed tests
1. Complete the functions in `services/queries.js` using the Supabase client
1. As a stretch, you can try rewriting the queries using the Supabase API and `fetch`
